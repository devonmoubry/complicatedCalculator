Not So Basic Calculator
-----------------------

What is It?
-----------

A calculator using basic javascript. The calculator will display any number or operation button pressed until =. This can only accurately calculate one operator at a time and the answer can only be 8 digits long. After this, an error message occurs. The CSS has a nostalgic font and sepia color palette. This is an Iron Yard assignment for Front End programming spring 2017 cohort.

Twaaaaaaas...just a little bit of luck that I was born a baby duck,
With yellow socks and yellow shoes that I may go wherever I choose,
Quack quack quack quack quack. Quack quack quack quack quack.
Quack quack quack quack quack. Quack quack quack quack quack.
